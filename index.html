<h2><small>BIGGER PERSON by Lauren Spencer Smith</small></h2>
<p>When you'd yell I would stay silent
You never noticed I was quiet
I was taught that speaking up was talking back
Always first to say, "I'm sorry"
'Cause I wanted you to like me
And I thought that's what it took to make it last

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us working?
It's always up to me even though it shouldn't be
I'll take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I'd do for you I was half of this dynamic
I was stable, you were manic
Without you or with you, comes with a cost
I got used to the excuses
And emotional abuses
We kept moving the lines we'd never cross

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us working?
It's always up to me even though it shouldn't be
I'll take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I'd do for you</p>

<h3>28 by Lauren Spencer Smith</h3>
<p>
When you first told me about her, you said she was thirty
And I just can't help but think you knew it was dirty
And maybe you were just a little sad
But there's no excuse to lie to me like that
When you first told me about her, you said she was thirty

But she's only twenty-eight, I'm not even half her age
She probably just had her first high school reunion
You're probably the first one she's ever moved in with
You think that I wanna hate, but you set me up this way
So, for my health, I'll bе blocking your number
'Cause you couldn't wait 'til I got a bit older

And somеtimes I kinda feel like I want to forgive
But it never crossed your mind that maybe I'm still a kid
And I'm so used to being the adult
Even when you say it's not your fault
But I'm kinda getting sick and tired of crying
So, please, stop lying, and lying, and lying

She's only twenty-eight, I'm not even half her age
She probably just had her first high school reunion
You're probably the first one she's ever moved in with
You think that I wanna hate, but you set me up this way
So, for my health, I'll be blocking your number
'Cause you couldn't wait 'til I got a bit older
To tell me she was twenty-eight</p>
