<h2><small>BIGGER PERSON by Lauren Spencer Smith</small></h2>
<p>When you'd yell I would stay silent
You never noticed I was quiet
I was taught that speaking up was talking back
Always first to say, "I'm sorry"
'Cause I wanted you to like me
And I thought that's what it took to make it last

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us working?
It's always up to me even though it shouldn't be
I'll take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I'd do for you I was half of this dynamic
I was stable, you were manic
Without you or with you, comes with a cost
I got used to the excuses
And emotional abuses
We kept moving the lines we'd never cross

It's a lose-lose
That I don't choose
But you don't always choose the ones you love

I shouldn't have to be the bigger person
How come I have to break to keep us working?
It's always up to me even though it shouldn't be
I'll take the blame the way you want me to
'Cause that's what I'd do for you</p>

<h3>STICK SEASON by Noah Kahan</h3>
<p>As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart
Like halfway through the drive
'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger
And the blame that I can't face
And memories are something
Even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks and I
Saw your mom she forgot that I existed and
It's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do, ooh, ooh
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
Once called me forever now you still can't call me back</p>
