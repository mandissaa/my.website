<h2><small>BIGGER PERSON by Lauren Spencer Smith</small></h2>
<p>When you'd yell I would stay silent<br>
You never noticed I was quiet<br>
I was taught that speaking up was talking back<br>
Always first to say, "I'm sorry"<br>
'Cause I wanted you to like me<br>
And I thought that's what it took to make it last<br>
<br>
It's a lose-lose<br>
That I don't choose<br>
But you don't always choose the ones you love<br>
<br>s
I shouldn't have to be the bigger person<br>
How come I have to break to keep us working?<br>
It's always up to me even though it shouldn't be<br>
I'll take the blame the way you want me to<br>
'Cause that's what I'd do for you I was half of this dynamic<br>
I was stable, you were manic<br>
Without you or with you, comes with a cost<br>
I got used to the excuses<br>
And emotional abuses<br>
We kept moving the lines we'd never cross<br>

<h3>28 by Lauren Spencer Smith</h3>
<p>
When you first told me about her, you said she was thirty<br>
And I just can't help but think you knew it was dirty<br>
And maybe you were just a little sad<br>
But there's no excuse to lie to me like that<br>
When you first told me about her, you said she was thirty<br>

But she's only twenty-eight, I'm not even half her age<br>
She probably just had her first high school reunion<br>
You're probably the first one she's ever moved in with<br>
You think that I wanna hate, but you set me up this way<br>
So, for my health, I'll bе blocking your number<br>
'Cause you couldn't wait 'til I got a bit older<br>

And somеtimes I kinda feel like I want to forgive<br>
But it never crossed your mind that maybe I'm still a kid<br>
And I'm so used to being the adult<br>
Even when you say it's not your fault<br>
But I'm kinda getting sick and tired of crying<br>
So, please, stop lying, and lying, and lying<br>
